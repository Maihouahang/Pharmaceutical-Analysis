Xpert Learning Assistant. 2024. I used this website for help on Pyaceuticals_solution.ipynb step 15 for help with the for loop statements. In specific, it helped me with getting these functions typed correctly:     tumor_volumes = combined_df[combined_df['Drug Regimen'] == treatment]['Tumor Volume (mm3)'] and tumor_vol_data.append(tumor_volumes).

Xpert Learning Assistant. 2024. I used this website for help on Pyaceuticals_solution.ipynb step 16 for help with making a boxplot chart. In specific, it helped me with getting this function written out correctly so that my boxplot will show: plt.boxplot([combined_df[combined_df['Drug Regimen'] == treatment]['Tumor Volume (mm3)'] for treatment in treatments], labels=treatments).
